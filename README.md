# My-Arch-Linux-Backupfiles
It's just my back up files for the theming as I keep breaking my install lol.
If anyone wants to use it they're free to use it.

```bash
$paru -S gnome openbox obmenu-generator obconf nitrogen vscodium-bin kitty polybar conky concky-manager2-git termite gnome-tweaks xfce4
```

Some of the works aren't done by me and are a part of other projects.
