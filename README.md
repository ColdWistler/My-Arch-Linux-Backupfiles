# My-Arch-Linux-Backupfiles
It's just my back up files for the theming as I keep breaking my install lol.
If anyone wants to use it they're free to use it.

#Installing paru:
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
```
CLoning the Repository:
-----------------------
```bash
$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
```
```bash
$ cd paru
```
```bash
$ makepkg -si
```

#Installing the required applications:
```bash
$ paru -S gnome openbox obmenu-generator obconf nitrogen vscodium-bin kitty polybar conky concky-manager2-git termite gnome-tweaks xfce4 lxappearence
```





Some of the works aren't done by me and are a part of other projects.
